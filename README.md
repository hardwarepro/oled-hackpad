##  A's Hackpad

### Description

This is a custom macropad that has 4 buttons and is controlled by a XIAO RP2040 as my main MCU. It also has an EC11 encoder for customizable actions like volume control. The 4 keys can be set to do whatever actions you want, but mine are set up as key 1 to open Gmail, key 2 takes a screenshot on Windows, key 3 holds down shift, key 4 saves a file while my EC11 controls my device's volume.

### Firmware

This custom macropadâ€™s firmware was written in KMK, which is easy to be changed and very easy to flash to the XIAO RP2040

This is the case I built for my macropad!
